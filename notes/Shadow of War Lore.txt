--- Shadow of War Lore Overview ---  In the land of Mordor, the events of Shadow of War
unfold between the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings, expanding the saga of Talion, a
Gondorian Ranger bound to the wraith of Celebrimbor. Together they forge a new Ring of
Power, one untainted by Sauron’s influence, in a desperate bid to challenge the Dark Lord
himself.  Shadow of War’s narrative explores the nature of domination and corruption,
depicting the internal struggle between Talion’s humanity and Celebrimbor’s drive for
vengeance. As the Bright Lord, Celebrimbor seeks to raise an army of orcs through the
power of the new ring, turning Sauron’s own forces against him. The Nemesis System
personalizes these orcs—granting each unique memories, grudges, and ambitions that evolve
with every battle.  The story delves deep into the political and spiritual corruption of
Mordor, exploring themes of control and the cyclical nature of power. Minas Ithil’s fall
into Minas Morgul, the forging of alliances with powerful orcs, and the rise of the Nazgûl
all demonstrate how victory often demands sacrifice. Ultimately, Talion’s fate becomes a
tragic reflection of the very power he sought to defy.
