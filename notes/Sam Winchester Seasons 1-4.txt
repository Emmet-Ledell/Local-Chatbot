--- Sam Winchester: Seasons 1–4 (Supernatural) ---  Sam Winchester begins *Supernatural*
as the reluctant younger brother drawn back into the family business of hunting monsters.
Initially trying to live a normal life at Stanford, his world collapses when his
girlfriend Jessica dies in the same mysterious way their mother did—burned on the ceiling
by a demon. This tragedy pulls Sam back into the supernatural world alongside his brother
Dean and their father, John Winchester.  Throughout seasons one through four, Sam’s arc
centers on destiny, morality, and the burden of knowledge. He discovers he was chosen by
the Yellow-Eyed Demon, Azazel, to be part of a demonic plan involving “special children.”
His psychic abilities grow stronger, and his obsession with revenge deepens, driving a
wedge between him and Dean. His alliance with Ruby, a demon who claims to help him harness
his powers, leads him down a dangerous path of addiction to demon blood.  By the end of
season four, Sam’s choices culminate in tragedy—his killing of Lilith inadvertently breaks
the final seal, releasing Lucifer. The early seasons depict Sam as both victim and
catalyst, a young man struggling to maintain his humanity in a world that keeps forcing
him toward damnation.
