--- Kaladin Stormblessed (Stormlight Archive, Book 1, First Half) ---  Kaladin begins his
journey as a young man from Hearthstone, trained as a spearman and later pressed into the
horrors of war. Betrayed by lighteyes and stripped of rank, he finds himself enslaved and
sold to Bridge Four, one of the doomed bridge crews forced to carry massive wooden bridges
across the deadly chasms of the Shattered Plains.  At first broken and defeated, Kaladin
wrestles with despair, survivor’s guilt, and his inability to protect those he loves. Yet
beneath that despair lies a deep-seated strength and an emerging bond with a mysterious
spren named Syl. She rekindles his sense of leadership and compassion, inspiring him to
transform Bridge Four from a band of hopeless slaves into a disciplined, brotherly unit.
Through acts of defiance and clever tactics, Kaladin begins to embody the ideals of
protection and leadership, even before he understands the true nature of the Windrunners.
His internal struggle against hopelessness and injustice makes him one of the most human
and compelling characters in the early Stormlight narrative.
