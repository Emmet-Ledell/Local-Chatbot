--- Dalinar Kholin: The Blackthorn (Stormlight Archive, Book 1) ---  In the opening half
of *The Way of Kings*, Dalinar Kholin stands as a pillar of Alethi nobility and military
might. Once known as the Blackthorn, Dalinar’s reputation as a fearsome warrior precedes
him. Yet by the time of the Shattered Plains campaign, he has begun to question the
endless cycle of war and conquest that defines Alethi culture.  Haunted by strange visions
during highstorms—visions that show him ancient Radiants and the fall of their
order—Dalinar begins to suspect that the Almighty himself might be sending him messages.
His adherence to the ancient text *The Way of Kings* and his pursuit of honor make him an
outlier among the power-hungry Highprinces, including his own brother’s son, Adolin.
Dalinar’s loyalty to King Elhokar and his struggle to unify the Alethi Highprinces define
his early arc. As whispers of madness spread and political rivals plot, Dalinar’s code of
honor isolates him, yet it also foreshadows the rebirth of the Knights Radiant. His
visions and moral resolve mark him as a man torn between the brutality of his past and the
hope for a more unified, honorable future.
